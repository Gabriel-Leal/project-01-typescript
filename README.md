# project-01-typescript
The project creates a comment system using React with TypeScript. It aims to develop an interactive application where users can view, add, and respond to comments.

The project structure is based on reusable components, following React's recommended practices. TypeScript is used to add static typing to the code, ensuring increased safety and efficiency during development.

The application allows users to view a list of existing comments, displaying information such as the author, date, and content of each comment. Users also have the option to add new comments by providing their name and writing the comment text.
